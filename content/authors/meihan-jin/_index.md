I am now working as an assistant professor at College of Urban Transportation and Logistics, Shenzhen Technology University. I obtained my PhD from Université de Bretagne Occidentale in France supervised by Professor Christophe Claramunt. I joined the team right after the PhD. The projects I mainly took part in include “Towards Theories and Methods for Spatial Interaction Networks Derived from Big Geo-data” and "Mobility as a Service: From Rigid to Smart Evolving Public Transport". My current research interests include spatial interactions, spatial temporal data mining and human travel behavior.
