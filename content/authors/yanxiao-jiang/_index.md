I am currently a Ph.D. student at S3-LAB, hosted by Prof. Zhou Huang. Before joining Peking Unversity, I completed my bachelor's and master's degree in 2018 and 2021, respectively, and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Liqiang Zhang. My research interests include applications of deep learning, such as attention module, population regression prediction.
