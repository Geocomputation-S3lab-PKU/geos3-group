The research group is currently recruiting postdoctoral researchers (either for scientific research projects or as part of the "Boya" postdoctoral program) to engage in research on GeoAI and urban big data. At the same time, we welcome undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students to join our group. Please contact us via email (fanzhanggis@pku.edu.cn).
