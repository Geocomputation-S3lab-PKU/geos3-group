Dr. Andre Python has studied and acquired professional experience in several European research institutes, including University of Oxford, Imperial College London, University of St Andrews, University of Lausanne, and University of Fribourg. His research lies at the intersection of statistics, natural and social sciences. Andre develops and applies spatial models and interpretable machine learning algorithms to better understand the mechanisms behind the observed patterns of spatial phenomena such as contagious diseases and political violence.  

His work has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK), European Research Council, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Scottish Funding Council and Zhejiang University. Recently, Andre has been awarded the Amazon AWS Machine Learning Research Awards to investigate Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm aiming at improving the predictive performance of spatial models. His research has been published in various peer-reviewed journals such as Science Advances, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Political Geography. His research has been communicated to a wide audience through publications in Significance, an official magazine of the RSS and the American Statistical Association (ASA), and a book Debunking Seven Terrorism Myths using Statistics, published by CRC Press and ASA.
