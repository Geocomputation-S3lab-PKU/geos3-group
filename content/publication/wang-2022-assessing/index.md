abstract: ' Bike-sharing improves individual mobility, considerably reshaping the
  landscape of job accessibility and commuting time. Existing empirical studies in
  urban transportation involving commuting usually collect survey data at the aggregate
  level. A comprehensive understanding of the influence of bike-sharing on commuting
  and job accessibility at the city level is still missing in developing countries.
  Using mobile phone data in Beijing, this study addresses these questions with a
  commuting mode model and cumulative accessibility model. The results indicate that
  bike-sharing could lead to a decrease in commuting time and an increase in job accessibility.
  The availability of bike-sharing services has a positive relationship with its effectiveness.
  Meanwhile, bike-sharing significantly reduces the horizontal and vertical inequality
  in commuting time and job accessibility at both the individual and spatial levels.
  These findings provide insights into the popularity of bike-sharing in China, shed
  light on the equity influence of bike-sharing, and provideÂ a quantitative measurement
  of the benefit of bike-sharing. '
