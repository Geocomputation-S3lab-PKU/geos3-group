abstract: Accurate and rapid censuses can provide detailed basic information for a
  country, which is useful for resource allocation, disease control, disaster prevention,
  urban planning, and business management. However, traditional censuses often take
  up much time, manpower, and financial resources. Population maps are created by
  national statistical institutes at statistical units. Remote sensing imagery combined
  with end-to-end deep learning models makes it possible to estimate a wide range
  of populations at a low cost. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a local–global
  dual attention network (LGANet) for population estimation using remote sensing images.
  The LGANet contains a local attention embranchment and a global attention embranchment
  on the top of the backbone to adaptively learn and integrate two discriminative
  features simultaneously. To enhance the precision of population estimation, the
  outputs from the two attention modules are combined. This method utilizes daytime
  remote sensing images as input, complemented by nighttime light data, to estimate
  the population on 1 km grids. Our method exhibits superior accuracy compared to
  other deep learning methods, as evidenced by an experimental comparison between
  the estimated population and the ground-truth population in 1 km grids.
