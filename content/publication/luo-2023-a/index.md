abstract: ' AbstractSpatial heterogeneity refers to uneven distributions of geographical
  variables. Spatial interpolation methods that utilize spatial heterogeneity are
  sensitive to the way in which spatial heterogeneity is characterized. This study
  developed a Generalized Heterogeneity Model (GHM) for characterizing local and stratified
  heterogeneity within variables and to improve interpolation accuracy. GHM first
  divides a study area into multiple spatial strata according to the sample values
  and locations of a variable. Then, GHM estimates simultaneously the spatial variations
  of the variable within and between the spatial strata. Finally, GHM interpolates
  unbiased estimates and uncertainty at unsampled locations. We demonstrated the GHM
  by predicting the spatial distributions of marine chlorophyll in Townsville, Queensland,
  Australia. Results show that GHM improved both the overall interpolation accuracy
  across the study area and along strata boundaries compared with previous interpolation
  models. GHM also avoided bullâ€™s eye patterns and abrupt changes along strata boundaries.
  In future studies, GHM has the potential to be integrated with machine learning
  and advanced algorithms to improve spatial prediction accuracy for studies in broader
  fields. '
