abstract: In forestry studies, deep learning models have achieved excellent performance
  in many application scenarios (e.g., detecting forest damage). However, the unclear
  model decisions (i.e., black-box) undermine the credibility of the results and hinder
  their practicality. This study intends to obtain explanations of such models through
  the use of explainable artificial intelligence methods, and then use feature unlearning
  methods to improve their performance, which is the first such attempt in the field
  of forestry. Results of three experiments show that the model training can be guided
  by expertise to gain specific knowledge, which is reflected by explanations. For
  all three experiments based on synthetic and real leaf images, the improvement of
  models is quantified in the classification accuracy (up to 4.6%) and three indicators
  of explanation assessment (i.e., root-mean-square error, cosine similarity, and
  the proportion of important pixels). Besides, the introduced expertise in annotation
  matrix form was automatically created in all experiments. This study emphasizes
  that studies of deep learning in forestry should not only pursue model performance
  (e.g., higher classification accuracy) but also focus on the explanations and try
  to improve models according to the expertise.
