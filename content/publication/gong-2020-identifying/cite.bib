 abstract = {Residents&rsquo; activity space reflects multiple aspects of human life related to space, time, and type of activity. How to measure the activity space at multiple geographic scales remains a problem to be solved. Recently, the emergence of big data such as mobile phone data and point of interest data has brought access to massive geo-tagged datasets to identify human activity at multiple geographic scales and to explore the relationship with built environment. In this research, we propose a new method to measure three types of urban residents&rsquo; activity spaces&mdash;i.e., maintenance activity space, commuting activity space, and recreational activity space&mdash;using mobile phone data. The proposed method identifies the range of three types of residents&rsquo; activity space at multiple geographic scales and analyzing the relationship between the built environment and activity space. The research takes Zhuhai City as its case study and discovers the spatial patterns for three activity space types. The proposed method enables us to achieve a better understanding of the human activities of different kinds, as well as their relationships with the built environment.},
