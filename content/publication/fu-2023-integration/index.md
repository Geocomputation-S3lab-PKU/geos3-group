abstract: Dockless bike-sharing is an effective solution for the metro's first- and
  last-mile connections. To create a more bicycle-friendly environment, there is a
  need to accurately predict the use of dockless bikeâ€“metro integration and understand
  its influencing factors. Previous studies have mainly focused on bike-metro integration
  at the metro station level, while we focus on the integration at a more refined
  resolution, i.e., the origin-destination level, which allows for more accurate measurement
  of the built environment factors and introduces the important factor of travel distance.
  Using 15 days of dockless bike-sharing data in part of Beijing, China, we propose
  a spatial embedding model based on graph convolution and improve the prediction
  performance of integrated flow. Additionally, we use XGBoost and SHapley Additive
  exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the effects of the route, metro station, and built
  environment factors on the integrated flow. The travel distance, the number of commercial
  Point-of-Interests, the metro ridership, and the distance to the city center are
  found to be the most influential factors. Suggestions for improving the bicycle
  infrastructure are made based on these findings.
