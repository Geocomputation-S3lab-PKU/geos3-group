abstract: The fusion of spatial data with blockchain technologies presents an innovative
  approach towards a decentralized, secure, and trustworthy framework for spatial
  information management. This integration brings spatial representation to the forefront
  of blockchain, opening avenues for various sectorial applications. However, challenges
  like slow processing times, restricted query capabilities, and consistency issues
  have been identified within the blockchain system. Addressing these challenges,
  we propose an optimized method for spatial queries by leveraging the high-performance
  capabilities of spatial databases. Unlike conventional off-chain query techniques,
  our approach synergistically combines hyperledger fabric with a specialized spatial
  database. This fusion facilitates distributed spatial queries within blockchain
  framework, incorporating spatial operation functionalities into smart contracts
  while preserving the distributed nature of nodes and spatial databases. Enhancing
  system security, we incorporate a dual-stage verification mechanism alongside a
  salt-hash storage strategy to counteract potential unauthorized alterations. Initial
  results validate the efficacy of our methodology in terms of performance and security.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce a rental transaction system that effectively
  merges spatial data with blockchain, demonstrating the feasibility and potential
  of integrating spatial information into the blockchain, especially in the realm
  of real estate.
