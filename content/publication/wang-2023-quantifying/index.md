abstract: Anthropogenic $NO_2$ concentrations cause climate change and human health
  issues. Previous studies have focused on the contribution of traffic factors to
  $NO_2$ emissions but have ignored the spatially varying impact of public transport
  supply and demand on high-resolution $NO_2$ concentrations. This study first applies
  a two-stage interpolation model to generate a high-resolution urban $NO_2$ concentration
  map originating from satellite measurement products. Then, we formulate 12 explanatory
  indicators derived from a fusion of massive big geo-data including smart card data
  and point of interest information, to represent the specific degree of public transport
  supply and citizensâ€™ demand. Furthermore, a geographically weighted regression is
  applied to quantify the spatial variation in the effect of these indicators on the
  urban $NO_2$ concentrations. The result shows that public transportation coverage,
  frequency, and capabilities as public transport supply indicators in metropolitan
  and suburban areas have a two-way influence on the $NO_2$ emissions. However, among
  public transport demand indicators, the economic level has a significant positive
  impact in most areas. Our findings can provide policy implications for public transportation
  system optimization and air quality improvement.
