abstract: Betweenness centrality (BC) is widely used to identify critical nodes in
  a network by exploring the ability of all nodes to act as intermediaries for information
  exchange. However, one of its assumptions, i.e., the contributions of all shortest
  paths are equal, is inconsistent with variations in spatial interactions along these
  paths and has been questioned when applied to spatial networks. Hence, this paper
  proposes a spatial interaction incorporated betweenness centrality (SIBC) for spatial
  networks. SIBC weights the shortest path between each node pair according to the
  intensity of spatial interaction between them, emphasizing the combination of a
  network structure and spatial interactions. To test the rationality and validity
  of SIBC in identifying critical nodes and edges, two specific forms of SIBC are
  applied to the Shenzhen street network and Chinaâ€™s intercity network. The results
  demonstrate that SIBC is more significant than BC when we also focus on the network
  functionality rather than only on the network structure. Moreover, the good performance
  of SIBC in robustness analysis illustrates its application value in improving network
  efficiency. This study highlights the meaning of introducing spatial configuration
  into empirical models of complex networks.
