abstract: End-of-life vehicles (ELVs) present both opportunities and challenges for
  the environment and the economy, where effective recycling management plays a decisive
  role. Recently, the primary focus of recycling management has shifted from simply
  meeting demand to refining and optimizing processes at the city-scale. However,
  the mismatch in recycling capacity has become a significant obstacle to maximizing
  environmental and economic benefits. To reveal this issue and propose improvements
  in the context of China, this study simulates end-of-life internal combustion engine
  vehicles (ICEVs) and new energy vehicles (NEVs) at the city-scale from 2021 to 2050,
  and analyzes their spatio-temporal pattern and recycling capacity matching. The
  results indicate that the number of ELVs in China will continue to increase, peaking
  between 3.5 and 3.7 million. This growth will be mainly driven by third- to fifth-tier
  cities, as well as central and southwestern cities. Regarding recycling capacity
  matching, most cities possess excess dismantling capacity, while first-tier cities
  face coordination problems in battery collection. Spatial coordination across cities
  or provinces is a viable approach for dismantling enterprises and should be prioritized
  over indiscriminate deregistration or establishing new facilities. The absence of
  initiative within the recycling system results in uncoordinated battery collection.
  Implementing a recycling-sharing mechanism and establishing a reuse market can effectively
  tackle this problem by leveraging market incentives. These analyses provide practical
  suggestions to maximize the environmental and economic benefits of resource recycling,
  thereby contributing to the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
