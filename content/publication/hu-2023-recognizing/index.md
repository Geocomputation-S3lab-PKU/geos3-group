abstract: ' ABSTRACTWhen various urban functions are integrated into one location,
  they form a mixture of functions. The emerging big data promote an alternative way
  to identify mixed functions. However, current methods are largely unable to extract
  deep features in these data, resulting in low accuracy. In this study, we focused
  on recognizing mixed urban functions from the perspective of human activities, which
  are essential indicators of functional areas in a city. We proposed a framework
  to comprehensively extract deep features of human activities in big data, including
  activity dynamics, mobility interactions, and activity semantics, through representation
  learning methods. Then, integrating these features, we employed fuzzy clustering
  to identify the mixture of urban functions. We conducted a case study using taxi
  flow and social media data in Beijing, China, in which five urban functions and
  their correlations with land use were recognized. The mixture degree of urban functions
  in each location was revealed, which had a negative correlation with taxi trip distance.
  The results confirmed the advantages of our method in understanding mixed urban
  functions by employing various representation learning methods to comprehensively
  depict human activities. This study has important implications for urban planners
  in understanding urban systems and developing better strategies. '
