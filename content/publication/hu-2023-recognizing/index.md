abstract: When various urban functions are integrated into one location, they form
  a mixture of functions. The emerging big data promote an alternative way to identify
  mixed functions. However, current methods are largely unable to extract deep features
  in these data, resulting in low accuracy. In this study, we focused on recognizing
  mixed urban functions from the perspective of human activities, which are essential
  indicators of functional areas in a city. We proposed a framework to comprehensively
  extract deep features of human activities in big data, including activity dynamics,
  mobility interactions, and activity semantics, through representation learning methods.
  Then, integrating these features, we employed fuzzy clustering to identify the mixture
  of urban functions. We conducted a case study using taxi flow and social media data
  in Beijing, China, in which five urban functions and their correlations with land
  use were recognized. The mixture degree of urban functions in each location was
  revealed, which had a negative correlation with taxi trip distance. The results
  confirmed the advantages of our method in understanding mixed urban functions by
  employing various representation learning methods to comprehensively depict human
  activities. This study has important implications for urban planners in understanding
  urban systems and developing better strategies.
