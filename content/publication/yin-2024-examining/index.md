abstract: Active travel, namely walking and cycling, is an eco-friendly and socially
  beneficial mode of sustainable transportation. However, existing research on active
  travel relies on limited survey data and generalized linear models. To fill the
  gap, our study integrates large-scale big trip data and data-driven machine learning
  to simultaneously predict active travel flow and probability. We employ SHapley
  Additive exPlanation to analyze the nonlinear effects of various characteristics
  (e.g., travel, socioeconomic, infrastructure, environment) on active travel. Gradient
  Boosting Decision Tree performs best for both prediction tasks. The overall importance
  of travel distance is over 50% to the model. Features like crow-fly distance, housing
  price, point-of-interest density, subway proximity, building area/road density,
  and urban greenery exhibit pronounced nonlinear effects. Local interpretability
  analysis reveals the determinants of specific trips, facilitating targeted optimization
  implications. Our study reveals the drivers and nonlinearities of active travel
  behavior and aids sustainable transportation planning.
