abstract: Intercity population movement has been extensively studied since it is closely
  related to human society. Currently, city industry structures play dominant roles
  in the direction of population movement. Yet, the extent to which different kinds
  of industry proximity influence human mobility remains unclear. In this study, we
  introduce the concept of intercity industry proximity, regarded as economic distances,
  to forecast intercity population movement using a relational graph convolutional
  network. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in learning
  information from 18 industry proximity networks. Using this framework, we investigate
  the impact of distinct industries on population movement by traversing each industry
  as input separately. Results show that while all industries exhibit favorable predictive
  performance, slight differences exist. Specifically, the primary industry emerges
  as the most influential predictor of population movement, followed by secondary
  industries, whereas certain tertiary industries exert comparatively minimal effects.
  We also examine the influence of proximity thresholds for graph-generating on model
  performance. Theoretical explanations concerning face-to-face interactions for the
  diffusion of tacit knowledge are discussed, and policy implications are provided
  to enrich the current understanding of population movement.
