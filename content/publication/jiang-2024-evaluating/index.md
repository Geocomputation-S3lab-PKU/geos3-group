abstract: " The United Nations has proposed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\
  \ of which SDG11 aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient\
  \ and sustainable”. This is in line with Urban Vitality's objectives. This study\
  \ proposes a quantitative framework to evaluate the impact of urban morphology on\
  \ urban vitality. In this framework, a proxy that is more reflective of economic\
  \ and human activities is proposed for depicting urban vitality based on geographic\
  \ big data; then we use a Multi–scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR)\
  \ regression considering spatial heterogeneity to analyze the different effects\
  \ of urban form on urban vitality. Taking the Beijing Sixth Ring Road area as the\
  \ study region, the results indicate that tall, large–area, multi–functional buildings\
  \ have a significantly positive impact on urban vitality. These areas exhibit single–function\
  \ buildings and high levels of greenery, leading to inefficient space utilization.\
  \ Increasing road network density, as well as the density of transportation and\
  \ public facilities, also positively influences urban vitality. However, commercial\
  \ density has a negative impact on workday vitality. Furthermore, excessive green\
  \ space density, a high proportion of the largest green patches, and complex green\
  \ space borders all contribute to a reduction in urban vitality. "
