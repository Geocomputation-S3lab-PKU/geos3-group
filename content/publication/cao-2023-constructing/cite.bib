 abstract = {A city (or an urban cluster) is not an isolated spatial unit, but a combination of areas with closely linked socio-economic activities. However, so far, we lack a consistent and quantitative approach to define multi-level urban clusters through these socio-economic connections. Here, using granular population distribution and flow data from China, we propose a bottom-up aggregation approach to quantify urban clusters at multiple spatial scales. We reveal six ‘phases’ (i.e., levels) in the population density-flow diagram, each of which corresponds to a spatial configuration of urban clusters from large to small. Besides, our results show that Zipf's law appears only after the fifth level, confirming the spatially dependent nature of urban laws. Our approach does not need pre-defined administrative boundaries and can be applied effectively on a global scale},
