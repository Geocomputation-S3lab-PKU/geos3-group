abstract: A city (or an urban cluster) is not an isolated spatial unit, but a combination
  of areas with closely linked socio-economic activities. However, so far, we lack
  a consistent and quantitative approach to define multi-level urban clusters through
  these socio-economic connections. Here, using granular population distribution and
  flow data from China, we propose a bottom-up aggregation approach to quantify urban
  clusters at multiple spatial scales. We reveal six ‘phases’ (i.e., levels) in the
  population density-flow diagram, each of which corresponds to a spatial configuration
  of urban clusters from large to small. Besides, our results show that Zipf's law
  appears only after the fifth level, confirming the spatially dependent nature of
  urban laws. Our approach does not need pre-defined administrative boundaries and
  can be applied effectively on a global scale
