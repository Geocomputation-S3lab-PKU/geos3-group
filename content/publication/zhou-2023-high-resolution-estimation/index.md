abstract: Buildings are considered as one of the most significant sources of energy
  use and greenhouse gas emissions. However, few studies have estimated fine-scale
  energy consumption in the building sector, especially at the city level. This study
  develops a top-down approach based on statistical and geospatial data to estimate
  building energy consumption with a high resolution (1 km × 1 km) at the city level.
  Two representative cities, i.e., Beijing and Shanghai, were chosen to validate the
  practicality and applicability of the proposed approach. Highly detailed maps of
  building energy consumption and energy intensity with a resolution of 1 km were
  generated. The results reflect the spatial non-equilibrium characteristics of building
  energy use at fine scales. In addition, based on three urban morphology indicators
  (i.e., building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and building height), varying
  relationships between building energy consumption and urban morphology in different
  cities are revealed. The findings of this study may provide helpful scientific evidence
  for policy makers to develop appropriate energy-saving strategies for the building
  sector.
