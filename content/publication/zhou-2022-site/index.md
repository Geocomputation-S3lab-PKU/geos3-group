abstract: The site selection for hybrid offshore wind and wave power plants (HOWWPP)
  is a critical step to a successful HOWWPP project. In this study, a four-stage framework
  is presented for determining the most suitable marine areas for the siting of HOWWPP.
  First, wind and wave energy potentials are assessed as a foundation for the implementation
  of a HOWWPP project. Next, unsuitable areas for the siting of HOWWPP are determined
  based on exclusion criteria to avoid any potential conflicts of marine spatial planning.
  Feasible areas (not satisfying the exclusion criteria) are classified and converted
  into spatial layers separately according to evaluation criteria. Then, the triangular
  fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied to calculate the evaluation criteria
  weights. Finally, the site suitability of feasible areas is calculated using the
  weighted overlay approach and then categorized into five classes. To validate the
  effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study in Hainan Province of China
  was conducted. The results indicate that the marine areas with medium to very high
  suitability are approximately 1312Â km2 (4.7% of the study area) for the deployment
  of HOWWPP. The obtained results of this study can support potential planners in
  selecting marine areas for the installation of HOWWPP.
