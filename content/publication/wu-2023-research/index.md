abstract: ' AbstractAbout 30 years have passed since Michael F. Goodchild proposed
  the term geographical information science (GIScience) in 1992. In the past 30 years,
  GIScience has made great progress in expanding research findings and perfecting
  theories and methods. To understand the development progress of GIScience, this
  research conducts a bibliometric analysis of 9400 publications between 1991 and
  2020 in 10 international refereed journals and 2 international conferences of GIScience.
  We analyze the publication statistics and trends in GIScience from two aspects of
  journals/conferences and countries/territories. Based on the community detection
  of the citation network, we extract 15 research themes and show their leading authors
  and highly cited articles. Furthermore, the change of publication number in different
  themes over time can indicate the evolution of some research focuses in GIScience.
  The results demonstrate that the publication proportions of some themes grow rapidly,
  such as “moving object,” “volunteered geographic information,” and “geographically
  weight regression,” while the publication proportions of some themes are decreasing,
  such as “digital elevation model,” “planning support system,” and “ontology.” In
  the discussion, the journal distribution of papers on different themes is discussed.
  Moreover, we suggest a few research directions that are worthy of attention in the
  future. '
