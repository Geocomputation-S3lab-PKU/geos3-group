abstract: Road traffic is an important contributor to CO2 emissions. Previous studies
  lack enough spatiotemporal resolution in emission calculation at the road level
  and ignore the impact of the built environment on road traffic emissions. Therefore,
  this study develops a bottom-up methodology based on the traffic trajectory data
  to analyze the CO2 emission characteristics of road traffic with a high level of
  spatial-temporal resolution in Shenzhen. Then, the effects of built environment
  factors on road traffic emissions are investigated using multiscale geographically
  weighted regression. The results show a highly detailed map of CO2 emissions with
  high temporal (hour) and space (road) resolutions. The emission characteristics
  reflect the spatial non-equilibrium in road traffic CO2 emissions. In addition,
  six factors, including population density, number of workplaces, number of dwellings,
  density of main road, access to metro stations, and access to bus stops, have a
  significant effect on road traffic CO2 emissions. Finally, the policy suggestions
  are proposed for the reduction of road traffic CO2 emissions.
