abstract: ' Understanding the attractiveness of commercial agglomerations contributes
  to urban planning. Existing studies focus less on commercial agglomerations, and
  most directly use environmental supply factors to characterize attractiveness. This
  study measures attractiveness from the perspective of human demand. Specifically,
  we build a novel bipartite graph based on big geo-data of human mobility, using
  node centralities (degree, betweenness, and pagerank) to measure attractiveness.
  Next, we summarize multisource environmental features such as Point-of-Interests
  (POIs), land cover, transportation, and population, and use them as inputs to accurately
  predict attractiveness based on random forest. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity
  of the effects of these environmental variables on attractiveness is analyzed by
  multiscale geographically weighted regression. The results of the Beijing case show
  that: (1) All three centralities show a trend that the urban center is higher than
  the surrounding area, and betweenness is more reasonable. (2) Random forest can
  accurately predict attractiveness, with R2 for degree, betweenness, and pagerank
  at 0.903, 0.846, and 0.760, respectively. (3) The number of shopping POIs, the length
  of main roads, and the number of bus stops positively affect attractiveness, while
  the effects of greening ratio and population density are bidirectional. As for the
  service scope, about 70% of commercial agglomerations have an average service radius
  of less than 15 km, which is significantly correlated with the Voronoi diagram.
  Our results can inspire understanding the humanâ€“environment relationship and guide
  urban policymakers in business planning. '
