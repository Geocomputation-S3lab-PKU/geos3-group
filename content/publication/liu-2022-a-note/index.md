abstract: 'Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has reshaped
  the research paradigm of many disciplines. Regarding geography, this trend is no
  exception. From the perspective of knowledge discovery, geographical research has
  two major tasks: revealing big unknowns and discovering laws. Artificial intelligence
  helps geographers discover knowledge or even automatically extract knowledge from
  these two aspects. Compared with other geoscience disciplines, geography focuses
  more on discovering “universal” laws. However, in the process of seeking geographical
  laws, we need to deal with the trade-off between universality and geographical heterogeneity,
  the core in which can be expressed as the theoretical foundation in artificial intelligence
  learning: generalization and interpretability. Therefore, there is an inherent logical
  consistency between the two disciplines. Introducing artificial intelligence to
  geographical studies will help to strengthen the disciplinary basis. This paper
  gives an example framework for artificial intelligence to discover geographical
  laws, and points out the future directions of geospatial artificial intelligence
  and geographic information science.'
