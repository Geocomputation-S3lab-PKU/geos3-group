abstract: Simulating urban morphology with location attributes is a challenging task
  in urban science. Recent studies have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks
  (GANs) have the potential to shed light on this task. However, existing GAN-based
  models are limited by the sparsity of urban data and instability in model training,
  hampering their applications. Here, we propose a GAN framework with geographical
  knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban morphology simulation.
  We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn hierarchical features and
  design a geographical loss to impose the constraints of water areas. Besides, we
  propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban
  systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation
  methods by over 20% in all metrics. Inspiringly, using physical geography features
  singly, MetroGAN can still generate shapes of the cities. These results demonstrate
  that MetroGAN solves the instability problem of previous urban simulation GANs and
  is generalizable to deal with various urban attributes.
